# Web3 Implementation Notes

This file contains additional notes and considerations for the Web3 migration process.

## Initial Setup

1. Create necessary smart contract interfaces
2. Set up IPFS integration with Pinata
3. Configure SIWE authentication

## Key Components to Implement

- IPFS storage integration
- Web3 authentication flow
- Smart contract interactions
- Event-based data indexing

## Development Workflow

1. Start with core infrastructure (Phase 1)
2. Implement data migration tools
3. Test thoroughly before proceeding to next phases
4. Use feature flags for gradual rollout

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all Web3 components
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Performance testing for IPFS retrievals
