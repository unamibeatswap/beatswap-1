# üîë Add Your Wallet as Super Admin

## üéØ **QUICK FIX**

1. **Connect your wallet** and copy your address from the debug panel (bottom right)

2. **Replace the placeholder** in `UnifiedAuthContext.tsx`:

```typescript
// Find this line around line 15:
'0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', // Replace with your actual wallet

// Replace with:
'YOUR_ACTUAL_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE', // Your wallet address
```

3. **Also update** `AdminSetupHelper.tsx` with the same address

4. **Or set environment variable**:
```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPER_ADMIN_WALLET=YOUR_ACTUAL_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE
```

## üîç **DEBUG STEPS**

1. Look at the **debug panel** (bottom right of screen)
2. Copy your **full wallet address**
3. Check if **Role** shows as `super_admin` after adding your address
4. **Refresh the page** after making changes

## üö® **CURRENT ISSUE**

The app is working but your wallet address isn't in the super admin list, so you're getting `user` role instead of `super_admin` role.

**Fix**: Add your actual wallet address to the SUPER_ADMIN_WALLETS array!
