// Payment Flow Explanation for BeatsChain

export const PAYMENT_FLOWS = {
  
  // CRYPTO PAYMENT FLOW (Web3)
  cryptoFlow: {
    description: "Direct blockchain transaction with smart contract",
    steps: [
      "1. User connects wallet (MetaMask, etc.)",
      "2. Smart contract handles payment + ownership transfer",
      "3. NFT minted/transferred automatically on-chain", 
      "4. Producer receives payment minus gas fees",
      "5. Ownership recorded on blockchain permanently"
    ],
    advantages: ["Decentralized", "Automatic royalties", "True NFT ownership"],
    disadvantages: ["Gas fees", "Wallet required", "Crypto knowledge needed"]
  },

  // FIAT PAYMENT FLOW (PayFast)
  fiatFlow: {
    description: "Traditional payment with database record (no blockchain)",
    steps: [
      "1. User pays with card/EFT via PayFast",
      "2. Payment confirmed via webhook",
      "3. License recorded in Firestore database",
      "4. Producer receives payment (85%) to bank account",
      "5. User gets download link + usage rights"
    ],
    advantages: ["No crypto needed", "Familiar payment", "Lower fees"],
    disadvantages: ["Not true NFT", "Centralized", "No automatic royalties"]
  }
}

// HYBRID APPROACH - What BeatsChain Actually Does
export const BEATSWAP_APPROACH = {
  
  cryptoPayments: {
    result: "True NFT ownership on blockchain",
    contract: "Smart contract handles everything automatically",
    ownership: "Decentralized, permanent, with royalties",
    target: "Web3 users who want true NFT ownership"
  },

  fiatPayments: {
    result: "Traditional license (not NFT)",
    contract: "No smart contract involved",
    ownership: "Database record only (like Spotify, iTunes)",
    target: "Regular users who just want the music",
    
    // Optional: Later mint as NFT
    upgrade: "User can later 'upgrade' to NFT by paying gas fees"
  }
}

// REVENUE IMPACT
export const REVENUE_COMPARISON = {
  
  cryptoSale: {
    example: "$30 beat sale via crypto",
    platformFee: "$4.50 (15%)",
    producerGets: "$25.50 (85%) - gas fees",
    gasFees: "~$5-20 (paid by buyer)",
    totalCost: "$35-50 for buyer"
  },

  fiatSale: {
    example: "$30 beat sale via PayFast", 
    platformFee: "$4.50 (15%)",
    producerGets: "$25.50 (85%)",
    paymentFees: "~$1-2 PayFast fees",
    totalCost: "$31-32 for buyer"
  }
}

// RECOMMENDATION
export const RECOMMENDED_STRATEGY = {
  
  phase1: "Launch with fiat payments only (easier adoption)",
  phase2: "Add crypto payments for Web3 users",
  phase3: "Allow fiat users to 'upgrade' purchases to NFTs",
  
  reasoning: [
    "Most users prefer familiar payment methods",
    "Lower barrier to entry = more sales",
    "Can always add blockchain features later",
    "Focus on music, not crypto complexity"
  ]
