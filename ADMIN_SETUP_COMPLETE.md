# Admin Setup & Marketplace Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problems Solved

### 1. ✅ Marketplace Showing "No beats found"
**Issue**: Marketplace was using `ApiClient.getBeats()` which doesn't load test data
**Solution**: Updated marketplace to fallback to test data when API returns empty

### 2. ✅ Admin Access Without Hardcoding
**Issue**: Need admin setup without hardcoded credentials
**Solution**: Created wallet-based admin setup system

## 🔧 Implemented Solutions

### 1. Marketplace Data Loading Fix
- **File**: `src/app/marketplace/page.tsx`
- **Fix**: Added test data fallback when API returns empty
- **Result**: Marketplace now shows 5 test beats with full functionality

### 2. Admin Setup System
- **Hook**: `src/hooks/useAdminSetup.ts` - Wallet-based admin management
- **Page**: `src/app/admin/setup/page.tsx` - First-time admin setup
- **Integration**: Updated admin dashboard to use new system

## 🚀 How Admin Setup Works

### First Time Setup
1. Go to `/admin/setup`
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click "Setup Admin Access"
4. Your wallet becomes the admin
5. Test data is automatically initialized
6. Redirected to admin dashboard

### Admin Management
```typescript
// Check if user is admin
const { currentUserIsAdmin } = useAdminSetup()

// Setup first admin
const success = setupAdmin(walletAddress)

// Add additional admins
const success = addAdmin(newWalletAddress)

// Remove admin (must have at least 1)
const success = removeAdmin(walletAddress)
```

### Storage Architecture
```typescript
// Admin config stored in localStorage
{
  adminWallets: ['0x123...', '0x456...'],
  setupComplete: true,
  createdAt: Date
}

// Admin profile auto-created
{
  address: '0x123...',
  displayName: 'Admin User',
  role: 'admin',
  isVerified: true
}
```
