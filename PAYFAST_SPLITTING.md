# PayFast Payment Splitting - How It Works

## PAYFAST AUTOMATIC SPLITTING: NO ❌

PayFast does NOT automatically handle payment splitting. You need to implement this manually.

## HOW FIAT PAYMENT SPLITTING WORKS:

### 🔄 CURRENT FLOW (Manual Splitting)
```typescript
1. User pays $100 via PayFast
2. PayFast sends $100 to YOUR merchant account
3. YOU manually split and transfer:
   - $85 to producer (85%)
   - $15 kept as platform fee (15%)
```

### 💰 IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:

#### OPTION 1: Manual Bank Transfers (Current)
```typescript
Weekly/Monthly Process:
1. Calculate producer earnings from sales
2. Transfer funds via bank transfer
3. Send payment confirmations
4. Update producer dashboard

PROS: Simple to implement
CONS: Manual work, delayed payments
```

#### OPTION 2: PayFast Split Payments API
```typescript
// PayFast supports split payments to multiple recipients
const splitPayment = {
  merchant_id: 'your_merchant_id',
  amount: '100.00',
  splits: [
    {
      merchant_id: 'producer_merchant_id',
      amount: '85.00',
      percentage: '85'
    },
    {
      merchant_id: 'platform_merchant_id', 
      amount: '15.00',
      percentage: '15'
    }
  ]
}

PROS: Automatic splitting
CONS: Each producer needs PayFast merchant account
```

#### OPTION 3: Third-Party Payment Orchestration
```typescript
// Use services like Stripe Connect equivalent for SA
Services like:
- Peach Payments (SA)
- DPO Pay (Africa)
- Ozow (SA)

PROS: Automatic splitting, better UX
CONS: Higher fees, more complex integration
```

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

### 🚀 PHASE 1: Manual Splitting (Launch Fast)
```typescript
Implementation:
1. PayFast webhook confirms payment
2. Record sale in database with producer split
3. Weekly/monthly payout process:
   - Generate producer earnings report
   - Bank transfer to producer accounts
   - Update payment status

Code Example:
const processPayout = async (producerId) => {
  const earnings = await calculateProducerEarnings(producerId)
  await bankTransfer(producer.bankAccount, earnings.amount)
  await updatePaymentStatus(earnings.transactions, 'paid')
}
```

### 🔄 PHASE 2: Automated Splitting (Scale)
```typescript
Implementation:
1. Integrate with PayFast Split Payments
2. Onboard producers with merchant accounts
3. Automatic real-time splitting

Benefits:
- Instant producer payments
- Reduced manual work
- Better producer experience
```

## CURRENT PAYFAST INTEGRATION:

### ✅ WHAT YOU HAVE:
```typescript
- PayFast payment processing
- Webhook for payment confirmation
- Database recording of sales
- Revenue tracking system
```

### 🔧 WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD:
```typescript
- Producer earnings calculation
- Payout processing system
- Bank transfer integration
- Payment status tracking
- Producer payment dashboard
```

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE (Launch):
1. **Manual splitting system** - Track earnings in database
2. **Producer dashboard** - Show pending/paid earnings
3. **Weekly payout process** - Bank transfers to producers
4. **Payment confirmations** - Email notifications

### 🚀 FUTURE (Scale):
1. **PayFast split payments** - Automatic splitting
2. **Real-time payouts** - Instant producer payments
3. **Multi-currency support** - USD, EUR payments
4. **Advanced analytics** - Detailed earnings reports

## BOTTOM LINE:

**PayFast does NOT automatically split payments.**

**You need to build a payout system that:**
1. Tracks producer earnings (85% of sales)
2. Processes regular payouts to producer bank accounts
3. Provides transparency via producer dashboard

**Start with manual splitting for launch, then automate as you scale.** 💰
